Abstract- In today's digital era, ensuring the security of our data is of paramount importance. This paper presents an innovative approach to concealing data within images by leveraging histograms and a technique known as Huffman Shift Encoding. Rather than directly altering the image pixels, we adeptly embed information within the histogram, which serves as a condensed representation of the image. This method allows for the concealment of substantial amounts of data while maintaining the visual integrity of the image. Additionally, the utilization of Huffman Shift Encoding enables us to minimize the storage space required for our concealed data. Extensive testing on diverse images has demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Not only does our method safeguard data effectively, but it also operates with speed and efficiency, enabling the concealment of significant information without compromising performance. This approach holds promise for applications such as safeguarding digital content, transmitting confidential messages, and more.

1. INTRODUCTION
Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) has emerged as a crucial technique for securely embedding additional data into digital media, ensuring imperceptible concealment while allowing accurate extraction of hidden messages and lossless recovery of the original content. RDH finds diverse applications, particularly in scenarios like digital image labeling within cloud storage systems, where servers can embed supplementary data such as timestamps, user information, and labels into user-uploaded images for efficient management and reduced storage overheads.
Over the past two decades, significant research efforts have been devoted to advancing RDH techniques, often focusing on minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) distortion. Traditionally, RDH methods have been categorized into three types: Lossless Compression (LC) based RDH, Difference Expansion (DE) based RDH, and Histogram Shifting (HS) based RDH. While LC-based approaches efficiently compress images to accommodate additional data, they often suffer from a trade-off between embedding rate and image distortion. In contrast, DE-based methods expand the differences between adjacent pixels to carry extra bits, improving embedding capacity while mitigating image distortion.
Histogram Shifting (HS) has emerged as another popular approach in RDH,
allowing reversible modification of image histograms to embed additional data seamlessly. Building upon this concept, several HS-based RDH techniques have been proposed, such as Multiple Histograms Modification (MHM) and Prediction Error Shifting. These methods enable better embedding capacity and improved performance.
More recently, RDH methods with image enhancement (RDH-CE) have been introduced, relaxing the MSE distortion restrictions to achieve higher embedding capacities. These methods, evaluated primarily using Structural Similarity (SSIM), preserve image quality even with significant MSE distortion, thereby enhancing embedding capacity while maintaining visual fidelity.
In this paper, we propose a novel RDH framework with contrast enhancement, comprising baseline embedding and extensive embedding components. In the baseline phase, histogram vacancies are created by merging histogram bins to maximize entropy, followed by embedding additional data using a histogram shifting algorithm. The extensive embedding stage further enhances payload capacity through the integration of MSE-based embedding, ensuring error-free extraction of hidden data and seamless recovery of the original image.
The subsequent sections of this paper delve into related works in RDH-CE, detail the proposed framework, present experimental results, and conclude with insights into the significance and potential future directions of the proposed RDH framework.
Histogram shifting represents an innovative avenue in RDH, allowing for the reversible alteration of image histograms to accommodate hidden data seamlessly. This technique, as demonstrated by Ni et al. [9], involves shifting certain histogram bins to create vacant spaces, into which additional data can be embedded without perceptible alterations to the image. Subsequent advancements in HS-based RDH have further refined this approach, with methods like Multiple Histograms Modification (MHM) [12] and Prediction Error Shifting offering improved embedding capacities and performance.
RDH methods with image enhancement (RDH-CE) have recently gained attention for their ability to relax restrictions on Mean Squared Error (MSE) distortion, thereby achieving higher embedding capacities while preserving image quality. These methods, pioneered by Wu et al. [22], utilize techniques such as histogram bin merging to create spare bins for embedding additional data, followed by contrast enhancement to improve image appearance. Building upon this foundation, subsequent research has introduced enhanced strategies like automatic contrast enhancement [24] and adaptive histogram shifting [26], leading to further improvements in payload capacity and visual quality.

III. RELATED WORKS
Reverse data hiding (RDH) techniques aim to embed secret data within a cover media (e.g., image) such that the data can be retrieved later without affecting the original media. This has applications in areas like secure communication and copyright protection. Traditional RDH methods often modify the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of pixels to embed data [1, 2]. However, such modifications can be statistically detectable, raising security concerns.
More recent research explores reversible data hiding (RDH) techniques that allow data retrieval without altering the original media. This field has seen significant advancements, with several approaches focusing on modifying image properties that are less susceptible to detection. Here's an overview of some relevant studies:
•
Histogram Shifting: G Xuan. proposed reversible data hiding for JPEG images by modifying histogram pairs [23]. This approach leverages the inherent redundancy in image histograms to embed data.
•
Encrypted Domain RDH: Several studies explore RDH in the encrypted domain, where the image is encrypted before data embedding. This enhances security but requires careful design to ensure reversibility [18, 19, 20].
•
Contrast Enhancement RDH: Techniques like those proposed by Wu et al. combine RDH with
