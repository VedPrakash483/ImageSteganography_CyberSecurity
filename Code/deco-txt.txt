[9], involves shifting certain histogram bins to create vacant spaces, into which additional data can be embedded without perceptible alterations to the image. subsequent advancements in hs-based rdh have further refined this approach, with methods like multiple histograms modification (mhm) [12] and prediction error shifting offering improved embedding capacities and performance. rdh methods with image enhancement (rdh-ce) have recently gained attention for their ability to relax restrictions on mean squared error (mse) distortion, thereby achieving higher embedding capacities while preserving image quality. these methods, pioneered by wu et al. [22], utilize techniques such as histogram bin merging to create spare bins for embedding additional data, followed by contrast enhancement to improve image appearance. building upon this foundation, subsequent research has introduced enhanced strategies like automatic contrast enhancement [24] and adaptive histogram shifting [26], leading to further improvements in payload capacity and visual quality. over the past two decades, significant research efforts have been devoted to advancing rdh techniques, often focusing on minimizing mean squared error (mse) distortion. traditionally, rdh methods have been categorized into three types: lossless compression (lc) based rdh, difference expansion (de) based rdh, and histogram shifting (hs) based rdh. while lc-based approaches efficiently compress images to accommodate additional data, they often suffer from a trade-off between embedding rate and image distortion. in contrast, de-based methods expand the differences between adjacent pixels to carry extra bits, improving embedding capacity while mitigating image distortion. ii. literature survey lot of research had been done in this field. the research taken by various authors as follows: [1] in their study, sinha et al.
